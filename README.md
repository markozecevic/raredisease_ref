# Reference files for running the nf-core/raredisease

rmsk_hg38_*.bed files were created by running:
```
python3 split_repeatmasker.py rmsk.txt rmsk_hg38
```
and modelled after https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/raredisease/reference/mobile_element_references.tsv

(a gzipped) rmsk.txt wad downloaded from [UCSC](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/database/).
